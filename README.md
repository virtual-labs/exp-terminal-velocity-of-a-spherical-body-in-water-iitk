<b> Lab | <b> Fluid Mechanics Lab
<b> Experiment|     <b> To find out the terminal velocity of a spherical body in water

### About the Lab (objective):
The Fluid Mechanics Lab is designed to provide Chemical Engineering students with hands-on experience in understanding the behaviour of fluids under various conditions. The primary objective is to equip students with practical knowledge of fundamental fluid mechanics concepts and their applications in chemical and process industries. Through experimental work, students learn to analyse fluid flow, measure fluid properties, and evaluate performance characteristics of fluid handling equipment.

### About the Experiment 

This experiment determines the terminal velocity of a spherical body falling through water, where gravitational force is balanced by drag and buoyancy. It aids in understanding fluid resistance, particle settling, and drag force behaviour, relevant to sedimentation and fluid-solid interactions in chemical processes.

### Target Audience :
Chemical Engineering/science students, faculty members & industry persons

### Course Alignment : 
This lab is aligned with core and applied courses such as Fluid Mechanics, Momentum Transfer, and Transport Phenomena. It reinforces theoretical concepts related to fluid flow behaviour, pressure dynamics, and hydraulic equipment performance, supporting students' understanding of fluid systems in chemical process design, reactor engineering, and equipment selection.
