<b>Requirements (Instruments, Chemicals & Other) : </b><br>

•	A glass cylinder of about 5 cm (or more) in diameter and about 100 cm in length<br>
•	Spherical metal balls of diameters ranging from 1 to 3 mm<br> 
•	Stop watch<br> 
•	Screw gauge<br> 
•	Meter scale<br> 
•	Experimental liquid (water) <br><br>

<b>Procedure : </b><br>

1.	Select three sets of balls; measure the diameter (2r) and hence the radius (r) of each ball by screw gauge. If the balls are very small, use a microscope for the measurement of the radius. <br>
2.	Set the cylinder vertically on a stand and pour the experimental liquid (water) slowly. <br>
3.	Measure the height H of the liquid column by a meter scale. <br>
4.	Put horizontal marks Y and Z on the outer surface of the cylinder. <br>
5.	Wet the balls thoroughly in the experimental liquid and then drop one ball from each set gently one by one starting from the largest size with the help of a spatula into the liquid in the cylinder so that they fall centrally. <br>
6.	For each ball, note the times of crossing of the distances Y and Z by a stop watch. Note the reading in Table. <br>
7.	After adjusting the positions of the markings Y and Z, drop the balls of one set gently again one by one and note by a stop watch the time taken by each ball in crossing the marks Y and Z. Measure the distance YZ by a meter scale and obtain the terminal velocity ( v' ) by dividing the distance by the mean time for a set of balls
