When a spherical ball of (radius r) is dropped in a viscous field it moves in it with certain velocity ‘ν’ (say) it experiences an opposing force (viscous force F<sub>d</sub>). According to Stoke’s law this viscous force is given by <br><br>

F<sub>d</sub> = 6πηrv <br><br>

Simultaneously it experiences an upthrust (or buoyant force) 𝐹𝑏 and gravitational force 𝐹<sub>𝑔</sub>. 𝐹<sub>𝑔</sub> tries to increase the velocity of ball whereas F<sub>d</sub> decreases the velocity. After some time the ball will move with a steady velocity, called the terminal velocity. Under the steady condition.<br>
