1.	Close all the valves.<br>
2.	Fill sump tank Â¾ with clean water and ensure that no foreign particles are there. <br>
3.	Open by-pass valve.<br>
4.	Ensure that ON/OFF switch given on the panel is at OFF position.<br>
5.	Switch on the main power supply and then switch ON the pump.<br>
6.	Open flow control valve and allow water to flow through test section by partially closing valve.<br>
7.	Open the air release valve provided on the manometer, slowly to release the air from manometer.<br>
8.	When there is no air in the manometer, close air release valve.<br>
9.	Set the position of pitot tube at the centre of the test section by adjusting the pointer to zero by knob provided.<br>
10.	Adjust water flow rate with the help of control valve and by pass valve.<br>
11.	Record the manometer reading.<br>
12.	Measure the flow of water, discharged, using stop watch and measuring tank.<br>
13.	Repeat the experiment for different flow rates of water by operating control valve and by-pass valve.<br>
14.	Record the manometer reading for different position of pitot tube at particular discharge for determination of velocity profile.
